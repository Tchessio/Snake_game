# Snake_game
Classic Snake game


My first Python application. Fully playable game created for fun and to learn basic python commands. 
The snake is a numpy array containing set of numbers. Each pair represent coordinates of snake's body parts. Every time the game loops new body part is assigned 
depending on the movement direction and the last element of the array is deleted unless Snake eats food. 

The idea is to create also the algorithm using reinforcement learning able to play this game.
